    <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
    <p>Setting up an Ubuntu server correctly and installing Apache are foundational steps for hosting web applications. In this guide, we&#39;ll walk you through the initial server setup on Ubuntu, installing the Apache web server, and further securing your server with a LAMP stack and Let&#39;s Encrypt SSL certificates. We&#39;ll also touch on how to configure your domain, purchased from Namecheap, and set up other essential services and applications like WordPress and phpMyAdmin.</p>
    <p><strong>Part 1: Initial Server Setup with Ubuntu</strong></p>
    <p>Before you dive into the world of web hosting, the initial setup of your Ubuntu server is crucial. Here&#39;s how to start:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Logging in as Root</strong>: Access your server with the root credentials to begin the setup.</li>
        <li><strong>Creating a New User</strong>: For security reasons, it&#39;s best to operate not as root but through a new user with administrative privileges.</li>
        <li><strong>Granting Administrative Privileges</strong>: Enable sudo access for the new user to run tasks requiring administrative privileges.</li>
        <li><strong>Setting Up a Basic Firewall</strong>: UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) is simple to set up and highly effective.</li>
        <li><strong>Enabling External Access for Regular User</strong>: Ensure that your new user can SSH into the server without restrictions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Part 2: How To Install the Apache Web Server on Ubuntu</strong></p>
    <p>Apache is a powerful and versatile web server that is an excellent choice for hosting web applications:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Installing Apache</strong>: Use the package manager to install Apache.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjusting the Firewall</strong>: Configure UFW to allow traffic on port 80 and 443.</li>
        <li><strong>Checking Your Web Server</strong>: Verify that Apache is running and accessible.</li>
        <li><strong>Managing the Apache Process</strong>: Learn how to start, stop, and reload Apache configurations.</li>
        <li><strong>Setting Up Virtual Hosts</strong>: Configure Apache to host multiple domains from a single server.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Part 3: How To Install Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP (LAMP) Stack on Ubuntu</strong></p>
    <p>A LAMP stack is a set of open-source software that provides a robust platform for developing and deploying web applications:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Install Apache &amp; Update Firewall</strong>: Reconfirm that Apache and firewall settings are correctly configured.</li>
        <li><strong>Install MySQL</strong>: Set up MySQL and secure your database.</li>
        <li><strong>Install PHP</strong>: Ensure PHP is installed and configured to interact with Apache and MySQL.</li>
        <li><strong>Setup Virtual Webhost</strong>: Configure Apache to serve your domain using virtual hosts.</li>
        <li><strong>Test PHP Processing &amp; Database Connection</strong>: Validate that your server processes PHP files and connects to MySQL successfully.<br><img src="screenshots/phpadmin.png" alt="phpMyAdmin Screenshot" width="600"></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Part 4: How To Secure Apache with Let&#39;s Encrypt on Ubuntu 20.04</strong></p>
    <p>Securing your web server is critical to protect data and improve trust with your users:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Installing Certbot</strong>: Use Certbot from Let&#39;s Encrypt to install and manage SSL certificates.</li>
        <li><strong>Configuring Apache for HTTPS</strong>: Set up and test your virtual hosts to work with HTTPS.</li>
        <li><strong>Obtaining an SSL Certificate</strong>: Automatically configure SSL for your domains using Certbot.</li>
        <li><strong>Renewing SSL Certificates</strong>: Ensure your SSL certificates are set to renew automatically.<br><img src="screenshots/ssl_report.png" alt="SSL Report Screenshot" width="600"></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Additional Configurations</strong></p>
    <p>After securing your server and setting up the basic stack, you should also:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Configure DNS</strong>: Set up DNS records for your domain, which you purchased from Namecheap, to point to your serverâ€™s IP address.</li>
        <li><strong>Install phpMyAdmin</strong>: This tool simplifies database management via a web interface.</li>
        <li><strong>Install WordPress</strong>: Use the famous 5-minute install to get WordPress up and running.</li>
        <li><strong>Develop a Landing Page</strong>: Customize your WordPress homepage to make it visually appealing and functional.<br><img src="screenshots/wordpress.png" alt="WordPress Screenshot" width="600"></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
    <p>By following this guide, you&#39;ve set a strong foundation for your web server using Ubuntu, Apache, and secure SSL configurations. You&#39;re now equipped to host your applications securely and efficiently, with all tools necessary to manage content and databases effectively.</p>
